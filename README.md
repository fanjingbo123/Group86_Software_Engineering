### Virtual Bank Application for Kids

Welcome to the Virtual Bank Application for Kids! This project aims to create a fun and educational platform for children to learn about the value of money and banking concepts. Using Agile methodologies, our team has developed an initial release that includes several key features designed to engage children in financial activities, encourage responsible saving and spending, and provide a tool for parents to support their children's financial education.

#### Key Features

- **Account Creation**:
  - Allows the creation of virtual bank accounts, including both current accounts and savings accounts. This feature enables kids to have separate accounts for spending and saving.
- **Balance Tracking**:
  - Displays the current balance of both the current and savings accounts, helping kids to keep track of their funds in real-time.
- **Deposit**:
  - Enables kids to deposit virtual money that they have earned from completing tasks or activities. This function supports financial transactions that simulate real banking experiences.
- **Withdrawal**:
  - Allows kids to withdraw virtual money from their accounts, simulating the process of accessing funds for spending.
- **Task Setting**:
  - Provides parents with the ability to set tasks or activities (e.g., house chores, exercises) that give kids opportunities to earn money. This feature fosters a sense of responsibility and work-reward balance.
- **Transactions**:
  - Kids and parents can check the transaction history, providing a detailed record of all deposits, withdrawals, and task-related earnings. This feature helps in understanding spending habits and financial tracking.
- **Savings Goals**:
  - Enables kids to set savings goals and track their progress towards these goals. This function teaches the importance of saving and helps kids to learn how to plan for future expenses.
- **Parental Controls**:
  - Includes features that allow parents to monitor and manage their children's accounts, ensuring a safe and educational environment.
- **Educational Content**:
  - Integrates tips and lessons about financial literacy, helping kids to understand complex financial concepts in an age-appropriate manner.

These features are designed to make the Virtual Bank Application for Kids an engaging and educational tool, providing both fun and practical learning experiences about money management. As the project evolves, additional functionalities and enhancements will be implemented based on user feedback and further iterations.

Our goal is to create a robust, user-friendly application that not only entertains but also educates children on the importance of financial responsibility.
